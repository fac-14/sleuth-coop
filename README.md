## Getting Started
How to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

*Please ensure you have this software **installed and running** on your local machine **before** you attempt to run this webapp.*
> **Node** (via nvm recomended)
> see: https://github.com/creationix/nvm

> **PostgreSQL**
> see: https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides

### Setup

#### 1. Clone the repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/fac-14/sleuth-coop.git
```
#### 2. Install Dependencies 
```
$ cd sleuth-coop
$ npm i
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies in the `client` folder
```
$ cd client
$ npm i
```

#### 4. Ensure you have the neccesary Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `client` folder.
Add thisðŸ‘‡ line to the file.
```
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
```

#### 5. Setup the Databases
Create the dev and test databases.
```
$ psql (or pgcli)
# CREATE DATABASE sleuth;
# CREATE DATABASE test_sleuth;
# ALTER DATABASE sleuth OWNER TO [your user];
# ALTER DATABASE test_sleuth OWNER TO [your user];
```

#### 6. Add some more Environment Variables
Create a `config.env` file in the root.

Add theseðŸ‘‡ lines to the file, to make your local databases work, inserting your own psql username and password.
```
DATABASE_URL = postgres://[USER]:[PASSWORD]@localhost:5432/sleuth
TEST_DB_URL = postgres://[USER]:[PASSWORD]@localhost:5432/test_sleuth
```
Add a 'Secret' for password encryption.
```
SECRET = "[SOMETHING SECRET]"
```

#### 7. Build the Database
Use this script that runs db_build.js
```
$ npm run build-db
```
OR 
use pgcli to connect to the sleuth database and run the whole script from db_build.sql by copy/pasting into pgcli.

#### 8. Run the Tests
To make sure everything is working as it should.
```
$ npm test
```

#### 9. Run the Server
```
$ npm run dev
```
Wait for a `compiled successfully` message.

#### 10. Have Fun
The webapp should now be running on
```localhost:3000```
Now you can play with the code all you like ðŸŽ‰
